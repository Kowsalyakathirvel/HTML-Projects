        <p>A waterfall is any point in a river or stream where water flows over a vertical drop or a series of steep drops. <br>Waterfalls also occur where meltwater drops over the edge of a tabular iceberg or ice shelf.<br>
           Waterfalls can be formed in several ways, but the most common method of formation is that a river courses <br>over a top layer of resistant bedrock before falling on to softer rock,<br> which erodes faster, leading to an increasingly high fall. <br>Waterfalls have been studied for their impact on species living in and around them.</p>
